# it338-yo-react-fountain-spaces

Instructions
 
Create and test 3 sites built using Yeoman generators. 

One should use generator-webapp, the other two should use generator-fountain-webapp, and you can choose from among the react, angular2, and vue2 framework options. 

Please choose to implement the ToDoMVC or the Landing Page options, not the Hello World page for your chosen frameworks. 

Please develop the sites, built them and successfully test them (likely requires the use of the http-server package rather than the npm/gulp/grunt servers to prove they work.
